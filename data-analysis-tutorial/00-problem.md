# Problem Statement

## Core Problem This Solves

Many organizations rely on data for decision-making, yet most datasets suffer from quality issues, such as:

- **Missing or incomplete fields**
- **Inconsistent schemas across teams**
- **Outliers and anomalies**
- **Data drift over time**
- **Low trust in dashboards and reports**

Because data quality checks are manual, slow, and inconsistent, analysts waste significant time cleaning data rather than interpreting it. There is no accessible, automated, AI-driven solution designed to help business users instantly evaluate and understand dataset quality.

## Current Pain Points

1. **Manual data quality checks are time-consuming and error-prone**
2. **No standardized approach to data validation across teams**
3. **Analysts spend 80% of their time cleaning data instead of analyzing it**
4. **Poor data quality leads to unreliable insights and lost business value**
5. **Technical barriers prevent business users from validating data independently**
6. **Lack of automated monitoring for data quality degradation over time**

## Target Users

- **Data analysts** in small–mid-sized organizations
- **Business users** who rely on exported CSV datasets
- **Students** learning data analytics
- **Non-technical teams** building reports
- **Anyone** needing to validate data before analysis

## Value Proposition

This platform automatically inspects datasets and uses AI to:

- **Detect** missing values, anomalies, and schema issues
- **Score** overall data quality with clear metrics
- **Explain** issues in simple, non-technical language
- **Recommend** fixes and SQL cleanup steps
- **Track** dataset quality over time with monitoring dashboards

Users gain immediate confidence in their data, speeding up analysis and reducing risk.
